#What is the weatherapplication?
This application has been made for my study. We needed to create a web application that could 
connect to an API from the internet and save data to a local database.

NOTE: the application has been made with very little CSS tweaks because this was not necessary
for this course. 

# How start the program
1. webserver
2. weatherapplication

##Before we start
Make sure that you import the MYSQL database. This consist of 2 tables: login and weather
##the webserver
Open in your idea. set the DB yaml to your settings. then install the libraries. Open main.py. run the script.
##Weatherapplication
Open in your idea. NPM install the node modules. run ng serve.
